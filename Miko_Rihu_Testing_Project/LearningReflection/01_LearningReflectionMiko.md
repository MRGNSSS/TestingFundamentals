> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
I thought the testing experience was enjoyable, though it would have been more fun if there were actual bugs.

   
## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I opened gitlab on my other monitor and opened visualstudiocode on my main monitor. I Then wrote up the documentation part and preconditions required. Then i came up with test cases and tested them while i updated the step by step walkthrough of how to complete the test case. While testing a specific test case that had inputs, I wrote up what the inputs should be in the Variables section.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
I'm not too familiar with automated testing so I don't know what to recommend, but I would recommend utilizing inspect element and the page source code when looking at testing the front-end of a site.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
I've only used Visual studio code to edit files and find it to be easy with that.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
No, not really.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
no, not really. I have used GitHub before on other courses that require it's use and on my freetime with specific video game related matters.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
I suppose the use of Robot Framework would be my go-to, since I've heard from multiple sources that it's easy and reliable. But I have no personal experience from using it.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
The knowhow of how to use test automation frameworks and overall testing fundamentals seems to be an important skill. Also proficiency in databases/SQL and common scripting languages like Python, Java and JavaScript. Being familiar with APIs and cloud technologies is also very much in demand.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
Well first of all learning common test automation frameworks, but also more on the techincal side like learning more common scripting languages in-depth and getting myself more accustomed to cloud technologies. I feel like otherwise I have okay testing fundamentals and understanding of databases/SQL for example.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
I feel this project helped me learn alot in-terms of creating test cases and how to format test cases and bug reports. I don't really have any impprovement ideas and I think this was a good way to teach these fundamentals in software esting. P.S. Im sorry for the late return, I have had issues with schedules this semester.
